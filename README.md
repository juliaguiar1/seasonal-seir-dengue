## ðŸ“„ Project Description
This repository contains the implementation of a **SEIR (Susceptibleâ€“Exposedâ€“Infectiousâ€“Recovered)** epidemiological model for **dengue transmission**, incorporating **seasonal variation** in the transmission rate Î²(t) to account for climatic effects such as temperature and rainfall.

The model is implemented in **Python** and simulates dengue outbreaks in a hypothetical population over a three-year period. The seasonal effect is modeled using a sinusoidal function, reflecting the annual climatic cycle and its influence on the *Aedes aegypti* mosquito population.
